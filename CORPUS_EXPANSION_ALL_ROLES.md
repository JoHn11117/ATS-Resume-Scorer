- Roles with moderate updates (5-10 new keywords): +2-4 points
- Roles with minor updates (<5 new keywords): +1-2 points

## Validation

### Quality Checks

1. **Keyword Relevance**: ✅ All keywords appear in 10%+ of role resumes
2. **Frequency Threshold**: ✅ Required keywords appear in 50%+ of resumes
3. **Role Distinctiveness**: ✅ Each role has unique keyword combinations
4. **Minimum Coverage**: ✅ All roles have 10+ keywords

### Corpus Representativeness

**Total Resumes**: 29,783
**Date Range**: 2010-2023 (estimated from corpus)
**Geographic Coverage**: Global (English-language resumes)
**Industries**: Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Consulting, etc.

**Limitations**:
- Corpus may over-represent certain industries (tech-heavy)
- Some roles have limited samples (Corporate Lawyer: 28, Product Designer: 31)
- Keywords reflect historical trends (may lag cutting-edge skills by 1-2 years)

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Phase 2: Role-Level Refinement
1. **Filter Generic Keywords**: Remove overly generic terms (e.g., "ai", "ui" appear in 95%+ of all roles)
2. **Add Role-Distinctive Keywords**: Focus on keywords that distinguish roles from each other
3. **Experience-Level Keywords**: Different keywords for beginner/intermediary/senior levels

### Phase 3: Industry Variants
1. **Domain-Specific Keywords**: E.g., "Product Manager (FinTech)" vs "Product Manager (Healthcare)"
2. **Geographic Variants**: Keywords may vary by region (US vs EU vs APAC)

### Phase 4: Temporal Updates
1. **Annual Refresh**: Re-analyze corpus yearly to capture emerging skills
2. **Trend Tracking**: Monitor keyword frequency changes over time
