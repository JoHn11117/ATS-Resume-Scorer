Task 4: Implement SuggestionGenerator with location mapping

- Added SuggestionGenerator class to suggestion_generator.py
- Generates 4 types of suggestions: missing_content, content_change, missing_section, formatting
- Maps suggestions to paragraph indices for editor navigation
- Sorts by priority (critical > high > medium > low)
- Added comprehensive test suite with 12 tests
- All tests passing

Features:
- Detects missing contact info (phone, LinkedIn)
- Identifies weak action verbs in experience descriptions
- Suggests missing sections (Skills, Projects, Summary)
- Detects formatting inconsistencies
- Role-specific suggestions (tech roles get Projects section)
- Location mapping for frontend navigation
