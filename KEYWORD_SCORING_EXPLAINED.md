## Key Insights

### Why P1.1 Scores Are IDENTICAL (All 9.2/25)

**All 3 CVs matched exactly 7 required keywords** because:
1. **Similar roles**: All are PM roles in similar domains (aviation ops, digital products)
2. **Common PM terminology**: All use standard PM language like "agile", "scrum", "prioritization"
3. **Core PM skills overlap**: These 7 keywords represent fundamental PM practices present in all CVs

**Note**: Even though Aishik and Swastik matched different sets of 7 keywords, they both got 9.2 points (7 × 1.32).

### Why P1.2 Scores Are DIFFERENT

**Different scores** because CVs mention different preferred/niche skills:
- **Sabuj** (0.7/10): Only mentions "PRD" → minimal preferred keyword usage
- **Aishik** (3.6/10): Mentions analytics, Jira, MVP, UX, engagement → better coverage
- **Swastik** (1.4/10): Mentions analytics, Jira → moderate coverage

These reflect individual career focus and experience variations.

## Scoring System Characteristics

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Incremental**: Each keyword adds value (no harsh percentage thresholds)
2. **Fair**: Same points per keyword regardless of which keywords match
3. **Predictable**: Linear formula (matches × points/keyword)
4. **Transparent**: Easy to understand why you got the score

### ⚠️ Limitations
1. **Exact matching fallback**: Semantic matching unavailable (HuggingFace connection failed)
   - This means "stakeholders" won't match "stakeholder"
   - Synonyms like "product roadmap" won't match "roadmap" alone
2. **Generic keyword lists**: All PM roles use the same 19+14 keywords
   - Doesn't account for domain-specific PM roles (B2B, B2C, technical PM, etc.)
3. **Case sensitive for abbreviations**: "KPI" matches but "kpi" might not

## How to Improve Scores

### To improve P1.1 (Required Keywords - 9.2 → 15+ points)
Add these missing terms to your CV:
- **High value** (mentioned in most PM JDs): roadmap, requirements, metrics, product vision, cross-functional, data-driven
- **Good additions**: user stories, user research, market analysis, A/B testing

### To improve P1.2 (Preferred Keywords - varies by CV)
**For Sabuj** (0.7 → 5+ points): Add 6+ keywords like:
- Technical: SQL, analytics, Jira
- Product: MVP, UX, wireframes
- Growth: engagement, retention, growth

**For Aishik** (3.6 → 7+ points): Already decent, add:
- OKRs, PRD, product-market fit, customer feedback

**For Swastik** (1.4 → 5+ points): Add 5+ keywords:
- PRD, SQL, MVP, UX, growth, engagement

## Technical Details

**Matching Method**: Hybrid semantic + exact matching
- **Semantic matching** (70% weight): UNAVAILABLE (HuggingFace connection failed)
- **Exact matching** (30% weight): ACTIVE (case-insensitive substring search)
- **Threshold**: ≥0.60 similarity to count as match

**Current mode**: Fallback to **exact matching only** due to connection issues

**Impact**: Stricter matching → fewer matches → lower scores than with semantic matching active
