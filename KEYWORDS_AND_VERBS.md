## Using This Data

### For Job Seekers

**1. Analyze job descriptions**:
- Look for required keywords from your target role
- Note preferred keywords that match your experience
- Identify action verbs used in job postings

**2. Optimize your resume**:
- Use Tier 3-4 action verbs for leadership accomplishments
- Use Tier 2 verbs for technical/execution work
- Avoid Tier 0 verbs entirely
- Integrate keywords naturally into experience bullets

**3. Check coverage**:
- Aim for 50%+ required keyword matches
- Include 30%+ preferred keywords where applicable
- Don't keyword-stuff (P3.3 Section Balance will catch this!)

### For Developers

**1. Adding new roles**:
```python
# In backend/services/role_keywords.py
ROLE_KEYWORDS = {
    'new_role_id': {
        'required': ['keyword1', 'keyword2', ...],
        'preferred': ['advanced1', 'advanced2', ...]
    }
}
```

**2. Updating verbs**:
```json
// In backend/data/action_verb_tiers.json
{
  "tier_2": {
    "verbs": ["add_new_verb_here", ...]
  }
}
```

**3. Corpus analysis**:
```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/florex/resume_corpus.git
python3 analyze_verbs.py  # See ACTION_VERB_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md
```
