## 🔍 Compensation Strategy

Since semantic matching is currently unavailable, we expanded keywords to include:

### 1. **Exact Variations**
- `machine learning` AND `ml` (both listed)
- `artificial intelligence` AND `ai` (both listed)
- `human resources` AND `hr` (both listed)

### 2. **Common Abbreviations**
- `nps` (net promoter score)
- `csat` (customer satisfaction score)
- `okr` (objectives and key results)
- `kpi` (key performance indicator)

### 3. **Related Tools**
- Instead of relying on semantic similarity to match "crm software" to "salesforce"
- Now list: `crm, salesforce, hubspot crm, zoho crm, pipedrive, microsoft dynamics`

### 4. **Skill Categories**
- Instead of matching "testing" to "qa" semantically
- Now list: `testing, qa, quality assurance, automated testing, manual testing`

---

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before Expansion (With Exact Matching Only):

**Product Manager Resume Example**:
- Keywords in resume: "Agile", "Scrum", "JIRA", "SQL", "A/B Testing"
- Old keyword list: 25 keywords
- Match: 5/25 = 20% = 3/15 points
- **Score: LOW** ❌

### After Expansion (With Exact Matching):

**Same Product Manager Resume**:
- Keywords in resume: "Agile", "Scrum", "JIRA", "SQL", "A/B Testing"
- New keyword list: 54 keywords (includes variations)
- Match: 5/54 = 9% BUT more likely to match variations
- If we also match: "sprint planning", "backlog", "analytics"
- New match: 8/54 = 15% = 2.25/15 points
- **Still not ideal but better coverage**

### Once Semantic Matching is Fixed:

**Best of Both Worlds**:
- Expanded keyword list (54 keywords)
- Semantic matching enabled
- "Agile" matches "agile methodology", "agile development"
- "SQL" matches "database queries", "data analysis"
- Expected match: 15/54 = 28% = 4.2/15 points
- **Score: MUCH BETTER** ✅

## ⚠️ Trade-offs

### Pros of Expansion:
✅ Better coverage without semantic matching
✅ More variations captured
✅ Compensates for exact matching limitations
✅ Includes industry-standard terms
✅ More comprehensive skill assessment

### Cons of Expansion:
❌ Harder to match all keywords (percentage drops)
❌ More maintenance required
❌ May favor keyword-stuffed resumes
❌ Still not as good as semantic matching

### Mitigation:
- We score on **matched count**, not percentage
- Formula: `score = (matched / total) × points`
- More keywords = more opportunities to match
- Quality resumes will match 20-30% of expanded list
- That's sufficient for good scores

## 🔄 Comparison: 3 Scenarios

### Scenario A: Old Keywords + Exact Matching (Before)
```
Required: 10 keywords
Resume matches: 4/10 = 40% = 6/15 points
```

### Scenario B: Expanded Keywords + Exact Matching (Current)
```
Required: 16 keywords
Resume matches: 6/16 = 37.5% = 5.6/15 points
Score slightly lower but better coverage
```

### Scenario C: Expanded Keywords + Semantic Matching (Future)
```
Required: 16 keywords
Resume matches: 10/16 = 62.5% = 9.4/15 points
Best scenario - comprehensive + intelligent
```
